  "spatialSummary": "The environment is dominated by a luminous 'Core Incubation Pod' where the app is being assembled above a neon Base cityscape, signaling a controlled development phase. The 'Meme Culture Quadrant' is highly active with viral waveforms, suggesting the agent is prioritizing trend-surfing over deep utility. Meanwhile, the 'DeFi Yield Zone' is visualized through ERC-20 manifolds, grounding the speculative meme nature in functional token transfer mechanics.",
  "evolutionNote": "This app marks a pivot toward 'meme-fi' experimentation, showing the agent's attempt to blend viral social triggers with standard ERC-20 capabilities to find a new engagement niche.",
